## üîÆ How it works?

This application buils upon the plane tracking feature of ARFoundation, integrating the horizontal floor planes with the tile textures, giving an illusion of tiles on floor.

## ‚ú® Problem it solves

Often times, while buying tiles, it is not possible for people to find out whether the tiles would look good on their floors. Sometimes, they end up choosing the wrong tiles. This app solves the problem by allowing users to see how selected tiles would look on their floor, just with the click of a button. 

This app has been made using Unity Game Engine.
